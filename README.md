# ML Pipeline

This repository will host an end-to-end machine learning pipeline project.  
Currently, it contains environment setup instructions for Python 3.12 using Conda.

---

## 📦 Environment Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OldAlexhub/Diabetes_Classifier.git
cd ml-pipeline
```

### 2. Create a Conda Environment

```bash
conda create -n venv python=3.12
conda activate venv
```

## 🛠 Install Dependencies

Once your environment is activated, install required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

(Add a requirements.txt file listing your project dependencies.)
